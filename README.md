# Trivia Game

This is a simple trivia game developed using the Tkinter GUI library in Python. The game fetches questions from the Open Trivia Database API (https://opentdb.com/) and presents them to the user. The user can select a category and difficulty level, and then start playing the game. The game keeps track of the user's score and displays it at the end of the game.

## Installation

To run the game, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You will also need to install the requests library to fetch data from the Open Trivia Database API. You can do this by running the following command:

[pip install requests]


## Usage

To start the game, simply run the following command in your terminal:

[main.py]


This will launch the game window. From here, you can select a category and difficulty level, and then start playing the game. The game will fetch questions from the API and present them to you one by one. You can select your answer from the multiple choice options, and then click the "Next" button to move on to the next question.

At the end of the game, your score will be displayed on the screen. You can click the "Play Again" button to start a new game.
